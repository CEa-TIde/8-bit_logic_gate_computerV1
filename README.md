# 8-bit_logic_gate_computerV1

The 8-bit logic gate computer can be found here: https://circuitverse.org/users/13948/projects/49969

It is recommended to (make an account and) fork the project, so that entering programs is possible. (Also a bit less laggy.)

Note that the stack isn't working on this version, so the SUBR instruction and the return part of the NULL instruction (the program still halts if nothing to return to) won't work. The rest executes as expected.
